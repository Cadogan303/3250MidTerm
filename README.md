<p>As a team we've decided to attempt a second go at creating a Pokemon game
and adding a "create your own Pokemon" part as well where you pick the name
and pick the element and then the computer will randomize its defense
and attack.<P>
  
</P>We decided to take the unique parts of the codes that we've already written and 
put them all together to create a user-friendly Pokemon game. Some of the parts we took
were the randomizer for Jesus' code to randomize the stats of the opponent's Pokemon and 
the user's Pokemon when they pick "create a Pokemon". We also used Angelo's "create a Pokemon" code to help 
with creating the Pokemon for the user.</P>

</p>What was done by who:</p>
</p>GUI: Angelo Monreal ans Jesus Lazo
    Window: Garret Jordan and Jose Lopez
    README and report: Fabrice Sikpa
