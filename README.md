# User-friendly Pokemon Game

## About
<p>As a team we've decided to attempt a second go at creating a Pokemon game
and adding a "create your own Pokemon" part as well where you pick the name
and pick the element and then the computer will randomize its defense
and attack.<P>
  
</P>We decided to take the unique parts of the codes that we've already written and 
put them all together to create a user-friendly Pokemon game. Some of the parts we took
were the randomizer for Jesus' code to randomize the stats of the opponent's Pokemon and 
the user's Pokemon when they pick "create a Pokemon". We also used Angelo's "create a Pokemon" code to help 
with creating the Pokemon for the user.</P>

## How it works
</P>The code works by opening a window where the user gets the choice of 4 Pokemon or the choice to create their 
own. The four Pokemons they can choose from are Charmander, Squirtle, Pikachu, and Balbasaur. These four Pokemon's 
power and health have already been set. If the user were to pick to create their own, it would take them to a new 
window where they can name the Pokemon and choose its element and power. The Pokemon they created will have 
its health randomly picked. Now, once the user has chosen one of the four starter Pokemon or created their own,
the computer will randomly pick one of the four enemy Pokemon and have them battle with the one chosen by the user or the created Pokemon.
The four enemy Pokemon are Lulcario, Snorlax, Mewtwo, and Weedle. These Pokemon's stats are also already set with Snorlax having the 
most health but the weakest power while Mewtwo and Lulcario have the most power. Now, once the battle begins, a new window will open asking whether you
want to attack or not and the computer will choose whether to attack with the enemy Pokemon. If you choose to attack, it will of course do damage to the enemy.
But if you choose to not attack your health will go up but you will still take damage from the opponent if the computer chooses to attack albeit reduced.
Once you choose whether to attack
or not a new window will open up telling you the result of the user's chosen pick and on the main window it will display the health and power of the user's Pokemon first 
and then the enemy Pokemon right after. This will go on until one of the Pokemon is defeated.
